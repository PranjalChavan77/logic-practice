Write an algorithm that accepts two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) from the user.
Based on the operator entered, perform the corresponding arithmetic operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division) and display the result.  

Algorithm

Start
Declare numeric variables num1, num2 and character variable operator
Accept num1 and num2 from the user
Accept operator (+, -, *, /) from the user
Use switch-case on operator
Case '+': compute num1 + num2 and display the result
Case '-': compute num1 - num2 and display the result
Case '*': compute num1 * num2 and display the result
Case '/':
  If num2 â‰  0, compute num1 / num2 and display the result
  Else display "Division by zero not allowed"
Default: display "Invalid operator"
End
