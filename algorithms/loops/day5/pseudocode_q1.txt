Write pseudocode that accepts 5 numbers from the user and checks whether each number is even or odd using for loop.
If the number is even, display: "The Number Is Even".
Otherwise, display: "The Number Is Odd".

begin
  numeric nNum1 , nCounter
  for ( nCounter = 0; nCounter <= 4; nCounter = nCounter + 1 )
  begin 
       display 'Enter a number'
       accept nNum1
       if (nNum1 % 2 == 0) then
       begin 
            display 'The number is Even'
       end 
       else
       begin 
            display 'The number is Odd'
       end
   end
end
