Pseudocode to accept two numbers, divide the first by the second, and display the quotient

begin
 numeric nNum1, nNum2, nQuotient
 
 display "Enter the first number:"
 accept nNum1
 
 display "Enter the second number:"
 accept nNum2
 
 if nNum2 != 0 then
  compute nQuotient as nNum1 / nNum2
  display "The quotient is:", nQuotient
 else
  display "Error: Division by zero is not allowed."
 end if
 
end
