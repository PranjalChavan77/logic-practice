Write an algorithm that accepts three numbers as input and displays the smallest (least) of the three numbers

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Accept three numbers → n1, n2, n3
Step 3: Assume n1 is the smallest → least = n1
Step 4: If n2 < least, then set least = n2
Step 5: If n3 < least, then set least = n3
Step 6: Display least
Step 7: Stop
