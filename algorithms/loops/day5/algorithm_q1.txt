Write an algorithm that accepts 5 numbers from the user and checks whether each number is even or odd.
If the number is even, display: "The Number Is Even".
Otherwise, display: "The Number Is Odd".

Algorithm 

1. Start
2. For nCounter = 0 to 4 do:  // (this ensures 5 iterations: 0,1,2,3,4)
3. Accept number nNum1 from user
 If nNum1 % 2 == 0 then
- Display "The Number Is Even"
Else
- Display "The Number Is Odd"
 Increment counter: nCounter = nCounter + 1
4. End For
5. Stop
