Q: Write the Algorithm to accept two numbers, divide the first number by the second, and display their quotient

Algorithm:
Step 1: Start
Step 2: Accept two numbers â†’ nNum1, nNum2
Step 3: If nNum2 = 0, display "Division not possible" (to avoid division by zero)
Step 4: Otherwise, calculate nQuotient = nNum1 / nNum2
Step 5: Display nQuotient
Step 6: End
