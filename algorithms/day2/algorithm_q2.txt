Algorithm to accept the radius and calculate the area of a circle by using the formula: 
Area of circle = Pi * r2, where, Pi = 22 / 7 and ‘r’ is the radius of the circle.

Algorithm: Calculate Area of a Circle

Step 1: Start
Step 2: Accept the radius of the circle → r
Step 3: Set Pi = 22 / 7
Step 4: Calculate area using the formula → area = Pi * r * r
Step 5: Display area
Step 6: Stop
